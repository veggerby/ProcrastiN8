# Pointless Chain

The **Pointless Chain** enables the creation of never-ending chains of asynchronous operations. It is intentionally over-engineered to simulate the appearance of productivity.

## Features

- Supports customizable delay strategies
- Integrates with logging for simulated progress
- Provides endless chaining capabilities

## Example Usage

```csharp
var chain = new PointlessChain();
await chain.StartAsync(steps: 10);
```

## Remarks

This class is a satirical take on over-engineered solutions, embodying the ProcrastiN8 philosophy.
