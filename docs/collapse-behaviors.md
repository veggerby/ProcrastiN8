# Collapse Behaviors

## Overview

Collapse behaviors dictate how entangled quantum promises are resolved. Each behavior implements the `ICollapseBehavior<T>` interface and provides a unique interpretation of quantum mechanics.

## Behaviors

### ReverseEntropyCollapseBehavior

Simulates the reversal of entropy over time, causing promises to decay into a resolved state based on a probabilistic model.

### HeisenLoggingCollapseBehavior

Logs a fake value before resolving to the actual value, ensuring maximum quantum uncertainty in the logs.

### StringTheoryCollapseBehavior

Requires exactly 11 threads to wait before collapsing, simulating the interconnectedness of string theory.

### CopenhagenCollapseBehavior

Collapses all entangled promises to the same value, bypassing quantum uncertainty, as per the Copenhagen interpretation.

### EnterpriseQuantumCollapseBehavior

Simulates delayed compliance reviews and records metrics for OKR platforms, ensuring enterprise-grade procrastination.

### ForkingCollapseBehavior

Collapses one promise and forks multiple parallel universes, each recursing independently, in the spirit of the Many-Worlds Interpretation.

### RandomUnfairCollapseBehavior

Observes one promise and ripples the collapse to others, with no regard for fairness or quantum ethics.

### SilentFailureCollapseBehavior

Simulates cooperation without performing any actual observation, collapsing nothing but still recording metrics for optics.

### SpookyActionCollapseBehavior

Attempts to collapse all entangled promises at once, instantly and non-locally, simulating "spooky action at a distance."
