# Quantum Undecider

The **Quantum Undecider** is a core component of ProcrastiN8, designed to simulate quantum indecision. It provides ambiguous or delayed responses to queries, embodying the art of productive stalling.

## Features

- Emits quantum-like responses such as "Maybe" or "Awaiting entangled twinâ€™s input..."
- Integrates with randomness providers for unpredictable behavior
- Emits events for entangled decisions

## Example Usage

```csharp
QuantumUndecider.OnEntangledDecision += decision => Console.WriteLine($"Decision: {decision}");
```

## Remarks

The Quantum Undecider is not intended for real-world decision-making but serves as a humorous take on procrastination tools.
