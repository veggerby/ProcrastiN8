# ProcrastiN8

ProcrastiN8 is a C#/.NET utility library that provides absurdly elaborate tools for stalling, faking progress, and pretending to be productive. Despite its humorous nature, the project maintains high standards for code quality, extensibility, and testability.

## Key Features

- **Quantum Undecider**: Simulates quantum indecision with ambiguous responses.
- **Random Provider**: Ensures testable and consistent randomness.
- **Pointless Chain**: Creates never-ending chains of asynchronous operations.
- **Quantum Extensions**: Provides methods for entangling quantum promises.

## Philosophy

ProcrastiN8 embraces the art of productive stalling, offering tools that are absurd in concept but real in implementation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the solution using .NET 8.
3. Explore the `docs/` folder for detailed documentation on each component.

## Example

```csharp
var undecider = new QuantumUndecider();
QuantumUndecider.OnEntangledDecision += decision => Console.WriteLine($"Decision: {decision}");
```
